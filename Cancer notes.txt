        |    Try to prevent yourself from getting cancer; getting sick is a good thing.                          |

        |    If you do get cancer - consult a LOT of experts, do not go for the first thing that is offered.     |
        |    Chemotherapy (single treatment): Good results are a "latency to death" not measured on survival.    |
        |    Although it has its placed, it is not good to only do one thing such as 'Chemo'.                    |

Origin : How cancer starts and acts -  "Your only option is not only getting blasted with chemo until you die".
   
a) Failure in programmed cell death. 
    Cell is transformed and 'pre' cancerous, essentially the cell doesn't communicate to die. endless copies.
    Cell can have 'Necrosis' or turn into a 'Phagocyte' (hehe)
    All of these things are B.A.D.

b) Failure of immunosurveillance. 
    Every day cancer cells die within your body which means your immune system is good. 
    If this does not happen, tissue then builds and cell becomes a "Apoptotic" cell. 
    T cells main adaptive cells / B cells and natural killer cells in your immune system .
    Most cells in the body are 'Dyploid' but in sexual organs you have 'Haploid' cells which can lead to confusion by immune system. Pancreas as well. 
    Eye cancer is a bit different because of the way T-cells are composed; 

HLA Complex : 'How our immunity sees' -- has a lot of combinations or "unique_id".
    BIG TAKE AWAY : THE COMBINATION FROM MOTHER AND FATHER WILL LEAD TO YOUR OWN UNIQUE HLA.
    This is expressed on the surface of every cell ... your very own unique code with lock+key. 
    ANYTHING WITHOUT THIS unique_id == DEAD ON SIGHT by your immune system .
    Everyone .. and I mean EVERYONE.. has their own unique HLA ; there are no two that are the same, unless it is an identical twin ## even between siblings there is a huge difference. 
    Funny enough; find a partner that is most "Immunologically compatible" for strong kids. 

Immunology theory ; "In the beginning there was self". 

    Older theory: Identify self vs. Identifying non - self. 
        It was believed that cells had a very clear self marker (MHC/HLA) and that cells that did not have them had Antigen and were clearly identified as non-self cells. 
            Until Polly Matzinger dropped a bomb. 
            The theory no one liked: 'Danger theory' 
            Everyone thought she was wrong (ex playboy bunny) but turned out she was right. 
            It's not just the the (MHC/HLA) it turns out you can also put yourself in danger and cause damage. 
            You can cause an autoimmune attack through severe damage/trauma to a tissue, which will induce said cancer because the T-cells consider that tissue as 'foreign'
                This lead to the now 'combined theory' self + danger = autoimmune response. 


Development :   "So what happens if cell is not treated"

    Cancer Immunoediting Theory :  
        On a normal cycle - it goes through elimination and it deletes a lot of the cancer cells - think of cancer as not "one cell" - they are clusters. 
        However, there will come a point where the cancel cells do not fear the immune system anymore so they are able to thrive and eventually win due to immunoediting. 

    Treatments : " Broad mordality vs. Opinion. " - there is not a lot of competition going on. 

         Chemotherapy/Mono-therapy: induces tumor cell selection. - one treatment , bad if not combined. 
            Before antibiotic = few bacteria are resistant but majority are sensitive to treatment. 
            After exposure = only resistant bacteria remain - "natural selection". 
            Post selection = Vastly increased proportion of resistance in new generation of bacteria. 
            If only treated with one factor -- the new cells are all resistant to the antibiotic so the whole tumor becomes immune. 
        
         Surgery : Usually highly effective, but can be 'double-edged'
            If not treated correctly and any cells remain, this can be very bad. 
            Body sees damage > tissue repair > cancer gets stronger due to trauma induced from outside factors. 
            This helps the tumor hide better than it already was. 
            Tumor tissue = heterogenous tissue  , which can from microenvironment for the tumor to hide in.

                    |    Cancer cells - they are adapting and are effective over long term as a survival mechanism due to being broken metabolically.                               |
                    |    Cancer cells <3 'stasis' but they HATE abrupt environmental change 'Because they die'.                                                                     |

                    | Heat shock protein' are made inside of a cell and exported to ensure that all protein stays folded at high temps.                                             |        
                    |    This is required for the cancer to survive, but these proteins have two problems.                                                                          |    
                    |     One) Cancer cells do not want to get spotted, but to export their own heat shock protein, cancer cells need to restart the process of cell communication. |
                    |             This will lead to the immune system catching the cancer cell and will be attacked / killed.                                                       |
                    |             If this is not restarted, the fever will kill the cancer.                                                                                         |

        Prevention methods : Can be used in combination with therapies. 
            Nutrient therapy > Zinc / Omega - 3 : all have cancer preventive properties. 
            Muscle usage (IL - 6) : Due to MK cells being very 'dumb' they make great allies because of this. 
            Chemoprevention : 
            Vaccine prophylaxis : 
            Mestasis blockers : 
            Diagnostic screening :
